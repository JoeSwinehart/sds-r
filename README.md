# Social Data Science with R
This is basically course notes that may eventually turn into a book. It's a collaborative effort with [Brendan Cullen](https://github.com/brendanhcullen) and [Ouafaa Hmaddi](https://github.com/ohmaddi) and we'll see where it goes. The plan is to have multiple chapters of interactive exercises where you won't have to always leave the book to try things out. I'll update this README as we go and content is developed to provide a better overview of what we're covering (and link to any material we have created).
